## Creating a New Issue

We ❤️ code so please be sure to add the code you currently have - this will
help us address your question and use naming/syntax that is familiar to you.

We also much appreciate sample data files for the task you are trying to
complete so, please try to compress your data into a `.zip` archive and attach
that archive to the issue. Don't have sample data? That's okay, just be sure
to give us a detailed description of the type of data you might use.
